----------------------------------------

Database name used in code : Userdb
Collection name is         : users

1. Create a landing page that remembers who you are 
----------------------------------------------------
 
I have created a .js file named : Task3a.js

If the cookies are not set then on landing page (http://localhost:8081/) , user will be asked to enter firstname and lastname.

To check the functionality i.e  a sorted list of the top 3 matches that are closest to user preferences  
when the cookies are already set:-

	Please use Task3b to create database and the same database is used by this current task.
